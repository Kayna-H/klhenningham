"item when used by manager in inventory means (adding or removing) the types of products listed in the inventory, while being used by clerk in daily business transaction means sales and returns of a product (quantity, not type)"
The manager in this condition should be able to readjust the points based on his/her analysis.
"Reorder Point is used ambiguously as the second last statement states that the System reorders an Item when Stock falls below Reorder Point whereas the last statement states that the Reorder Points are adjusted by the System.The former use, which states that the System reorders an Item represents the key abstraction."
"Here, the manager will be responsible to adjust the reorder points based on the analysis of the store's stock in the past."
Item is abstraction that is used ambiguously. Item wholesale cost as well as retails price is based on the quantity of item bought or sold. This is kind of a ambiguous description of item.
"The term ""quantity"" is used ambiguously. Usually it means the quantity of something, but in the sentence, ""Either the cost or the price of the item may depend on the quantity bought or sold."" it is really referring to number. The former use is the key abstraction."
"the first one is ""the manager adds or removes items from the inventory"", and the second one is ""a clerk adds or removes items from the inventory when a customer purchases or returns an item"". The second ""inventory"" should be ""store"". And the first one is the key abstraction."
"we used to think cost is just the cost, its stactic, but now cost of the item may depend on the quantity bought or sold."
"Each item has a specific price and cost, this is the key abstraction.Either the cost or the price of the item may depend on the quantity bought or sold. Here it says the price or the cost is dependent on something"
"Here the Inventory class is ambiguous because the actual meaning of like that it should be representative catalog of all the items present in the store, it should contain all the details pertaining to the item, but according to the given problem statement the Inventory class holds only the number of items. Hence the key abstraction of Inventory is ambiguously represented in the requirements."
"inventory keeps track of the number of items (present in the store,when system reorders), which means the item is seen as the one which has several number of entities of type item,When The clerk adds or removes an item and customer buys or returns an item, it means the item quantity is updated(added/ removed),not the item itself"
"How quickly the store's stock has been depleted, and how fast orders have been filled in the past is ambiguous for reorder point."
"The two instances where stock has been used is ""when the number in stock falls below a reorder point"" and ""The system adjusts reorder points based on how quickly the store's stock has been depleted"". In the first scenario, it is used in the sense that it implies the quantity of items where as in the 2nd scenario, it is used in the context of stock of the store. The 2nd scenario represents the key abstraction."
"Item is used ambiguously in the requirements. It is referred as a type of inventory entity and also as the quantity in a few cases.It is identified as a key abstraction using the type of inventory entity usage where it has properties like barcode, price, and cost."
"""orders? is used in two different senses: as for ordering new item into the inventory, and as for selling items to customers. The second use represents the key abstraction."
"Item seems to use 2 different meanings in different parts of the requirement dealing with clerk and manager functionality. When mentioning how a manager can add or remove items, an item is treated as a representation for the product being added. For instance an item is seen as adding the product, ""Kellog's Frosted Flakes"". In the section about clerks, items are treated as specific instances of products. For instance, a clerk can sell a particular box of ""Kellog's Frosted Flakes"". Thefore, an item is treated as both a product/brand that could be introduced to the store, and as the individual instances of those products that exist at the store."
"usually it means the number of items in an inventory.But in the sentence, ""The system reorders an item, when the number in stock falls below a reorder point"", it is really referring to quantity of an item."
"The term System is used as a key abstraction where the requirement mentions the re-ordering feature. It is used as an active entity which re-orders an item automatically. Then in the next requirement, the same term is used, but not as an abstraction."
"Stock has been used differently in two ways. In the second last requirement, Stock is referred to as the number of items or quantity for a particular item whereas in the last requirement, the Stock is referred to as the complete inventory of the store or collection of all items in the store. For the key abstraction, the use of Stock should be referred to as the inventory of the complete store because the 1st use of stock where it is referred as item stock can be simply represented by the quantity property of class Item."
"In first line it is said that inventory has list of items and their quantity, but in last line we are discussing about stores stock.. so is that also means inventory."
"The term ""stock"" is used ambiguously. In the line ""The system adjusts reorder points based on how quickly the store's stock has been depleted"", it actually refers to the quantity of the item in question."
"""Either the cost or the price of the item may depend on the quantity bought or sold:""Here when considering the key abstraction item. First it is said that each item has a specific cost and price but then it is said that it may vary depending on the quantity. Thus it is ambiguous."
1. Stock term is used for all the items as whole and when the stocks are below threshold every item is ordered.2. Stock term is used for individually for an item individually and when the stocks are below threshold for a certain item that item is ordered.3. Stock term might correspond to stock market value.
"Ambiguous usage of key abstraction 'system' is as follows"" The system adjusts reorder points based on how quickly the store's stock has been depleted, and how fast orders have been filled in the past""The manager should be the one to adjust reorder points, not the system."
"One meaning of reorder point is the number when an order to refill the stock is placed. Whereas a reorder point can be implemented as a key abstraction where it has attributes of when to reorder, previous order records, demand,etc."
"The term ""stock"" is used ambiguously, In the line ""The system adjusts reorder points based on how quickly the store's stock has been depleted"", it actually refers to the quantity of the item.inventory is keeping the track of number of items, which means the item seem as the one which has several number of entities of type item,The item quantity is updated(add/remove) but not the item itself when the clerk add or removes an item, or when customer buys or return an item"
Because manager can add remove items based on inventory and clerk does it based on the stock
System is used as the tasks that are needed to be done automatically. Ex: 1*) The system reorders an item ...2) The system adjusts reorder points ...* represents the key abstraction
In one time it is used as the number in stock and then stock itself gets depleted
"how ""quickly"" or how ""fast"" are by themselves ambiguous. However, Keeping them aside, reordering has to be done based on the rate of order/stock filled/depleted for any given Item. But this description is ambiguous in the sense that the reader may think that the reordering count should be a global value for all items which doesn't make sense and it should be for a particular item."
"ReOrder can mean 1) a customer is reordering 2) system is reordering for inventoryHowever, in the given context, ""reorder"" the system will reorder for the inventory."
"It is first mentionedm, it is used when stock depletes and afterwards reordering is based on it so it is vague"
As it is not understood whether bought or sold
"The system here can refer to the inventory system for the small store.It can also refer to the stock handling system whose task is to replenish that particular item in the inventory when its value falls below a threshold value. Here, the key abstraction System refers to the latter case i.e. the stock replenishing case."
"the relation between stock and item is not clearly defined in the requirement.The last statement say ""The system adjusts reorder points based on how quickly the ""store's stock"" has been depleted, and how fast orders have been filled in the past.""how quickly the stores stack id depleted but it should be items stock depleted. This statement create ambiguity about does stock belongs to store or to item."
"In the following sentence, the term is used to describe a 'kind' of product.""The manager adds or removes items from the inventory, e.g., when a manufacturer introduces or discontinues an item.""While in the following sentence, the term is used to describe a 'piece' of product.""A clerk adds or removes items from the inventory when a customer purchases or returns an item.""To be more specific, a manager can remove a product completely or add a new kind of product, while a clerk can modify the quantity of a product, but they are all ambiguously referred to as ""items"".The first one (a 'kind' of product) represents the key abstraction."
"The term ""item"" is used ambiguously. Usually it means a kind of commodity, such as cola, but in the sentence, ""A clerk adds or removes items from the inventory when a customer purchases or returns an item."" it is really referring to several items, such as two cans of cola. The former use is the key abstraction."
"'The inventory consists of a number of items.' 'A clerk adds or removes items from the inventory '. The inventory usually means the number of types of items, but it was used there which represents stock of items."
Reorder can represent changing the order of items or Ordering items again. In the Requirement reorder is used for ordering the requirements again
"The system reorders an item, when the number in stock falls below a reorder point - Here there is a key abstraction because the system is given the task to reorder an item. However, the word ""system"" could have been better named because system is a inbuilt class.The system adjusts reorder points based on how quickly the store's stock has been depleted, and how fast orders have been filled in the past - There is an ambiguity here, because the requirement is still not clear on what exactly is the need here, for example, what is the measurement of fast and quick."
"Item refers to a type of product when it is stated that ""The manager adds or removes items from the inventory"" while it is sometimes referred to as quantity.The former use represents the key abstraction where it is referred to as a type of product."
"Each item has a unique barcode, a specific (wholesale) cost, and a specific (retail) price. (here the item represents key abstraction)The system reorders an item when the number in stock falls below a reorder point. (here items refers to the quantity of the item and not the item class itself)The manager adds or removes items from the inventory, e.g., when a manufacturer introduces or discontinues an item. (here item refers to the quantity of the item)"
It says that the inventory is for a small store but the number of items in the inventory are ambiguous.
"Line 3 says that price is retail price. So, it should be the cost of 1 unit.While line 4 says that the price depends on the units(quantity) sold or bought."
"""The system reorders an item"" - here reorder is used as a verb - ordering again.""number in stock falls below a reorder point"" - here reorder is used as a measurable quantity."
The item class which is used as a key abstraction is used ambiguously in the requirements. It is because when we have to keep a track of the quantity of the items then we can add the attribute in the inventory or item class depending upon what is the quantity that we have to track. Is it relevant to inventory of a store or quantity as in general. Because in one of the statements it is said that cost of an item depends upon the quantity. Since the quantity is not included in class field of item class it is ambiguous that how quantity is referred with respect to the quantity.
Requirement mentions that system adjusts reorder points based on how quickly the store's -- stock -- has been depleted. it meant same as how quickly -- ITEM-- has been depleted. So --- Stock AND Item --- is used ambiguously. Item is used to represent KEY ABSTRACTION.
item could mean the number of product and it could also mean the type of product.
"Item is used ambiguously. When a manufacturer introduces or discontinues an item, that particular item and the its corresponding stock/quantity is either added/removed from the inventory i.e. all the instances of that particular item are added/removed.When a customer purchases/returns an item, a particular instance of that item that the customer will possess/possessed gets added/removed from the inventory. Here , 'item' can refer to any item in the inventory.The first of these uses is the key abstraction."
"1>""The system reorders an item, when the number in stock falls below a reorder point."" - Here it is used to represent an item as a whole and 'number' refers to the quantity of that item. (Represents key abstraction)2>""The system adjusts reorder points based on how quickly the store's stock has been depleted, and how fast orders have been filled in the past.""- Here 'stock' is used to represent the quantity of an item and not the item itself, since it mentions stock as 'being depleted'. (Does not represent key abstraction, as quantity does not require a class for implementation)"
"Here stock is used ambiguously as inventory in line ""The system reorders an item, when the number in stock falls below a reorder point."". Stock refers to all the items in the inventory whereas here it is referred as qty of a particular item."
"- System is used to reorder items when they fall below a certain reorder point - but system is ambiguous since it can mean either an automated piece of software or a manager or an employee higher than a manager or the inventory management software in itself which can do this task without validation/acceptance from the managers.- System also calculates the reorder points, which can instead be a minor function in the inventory class itself.- Here, the key abstraction is the inventory class - and it can have associations to the order, manager and clerk classes so as to facilitate the same functions intended as the ambiguous ""system"""
"System will reorder an item if it falls beyond a reorder point.now, the reorder point is a part of specific item, so when manager adds an item he should adjust the reorder points, because he is the one adding it. However in the last line of the description it is mentioned that system adjusts the reorder points. Who should change the reorder points system or manager is ambiguous."
"Usually the stock refers to the shares of the company or the store. But in the sentence ""The system adjusts reorder points based on how quickly the store's stock has been depleted"", stock means the quantity of the items present Inventory, in which case it refers to the Inventory key abstraction."
"The system could be the system that is implementing this inventory software. But in this sense, system is a class that is responsible for reordering the items as well as adjusting the reorder point."
"System and Inventory are stated in ambiguous terms in the requirement specifications. System cannot be made a class itself if we do we would have only one class for the entire product. That's not O-O. So, I think Inventory should hold the quantity of the items it possesses and should have the responsibility of reordering the items and adjusting the reorder points."
"System appears to be the synonymous to the inventory class. The logic for adjusting reorder points appears to be ambiguous. How are we computing how quickly the store's stock is depleted or how fast orders have been filled?Also, quantity and stock appear to be synonymous used too."
"Here according to me, system is the key abstraction that is used ambiguously used in the requirement. Becuase requirement states the noun 'inventory' in the very first line and that is what the system for which requirements are. instead of using system as key abstraction, we can use inventory class."
- Reorder Point is ambiguous as it is unclear when the reorder will happen- Then key abstraction would be to use the reorder points to determine the Reorder- The calculation of reorder points from reorder is ambiguous as it forms cycle and it is unclear which parameter determines what i.e. whether reorder points determine reorder or reorder determines reorder points
"The term Inventory is used ambiguously. Usually it means Inventory but in the sentence ""A clerk adds or removes items from the inventory when a customer purchases or returns an item."" it means stock."
"It is also referred to as stocks, while both of them represent the same thing"
"It is mentioned that a manager can add/remove items from inventory, implying type of product. Also, in another sentence, it refers to the quantity of product (""system reorders an item"")."
In this requirement inventory could be a collection of different varieties of products and also can be as the quantity of item when the items are being sold or purchased.
"It is ambiguous to determine whether the stock refers to the inventory or the itemsThe scenario where stock refers to item is considered.Since it has been mentioned that once stock is depleted, reorder point is updated. That means that stock refers to one item and on depletion of number of that item, reorder is done."
"User is represented as a Manager, User is represented as a Clerk.The key abstraction is User. Even though User is not directly used anywhere in the description, it is evident that the key abstraction is User."
"1. the capital raised by a business or corporation through the issue and subscription of shares.2. the goods or merchandise kept on the premises of a business or warehouse and available for sale or distribution2nd meaning is used, as it is referenced with the items"
An item has a wholesale cost and a retail price which is a number and it is ambiguously used in two scenarios.The retail price is the key abstraction as it is the price for which customers purchase goods for.
"Item in some cases implies to be a type of product and in some cases it implies to be the quantity of a product.The case in which it implies to be a type of product, that is the key abstraction"
"->It may mean the whole ""system"" in itself, like said in the problem title.->I may also mean a sub-system in the application which has the task of reordering items based on a threshold and also changing that threshold.The second representation is the key abstraction talked of in our case."
"Stock is ambiguous as it seems like it is something which contains the quantity of each item in the inventory but when clerk is the contributor it is mentioned that ""adds or removes items from the inventory when a customer purchases or returns an item"". So it is unsure between the purpose of Stock and inventory. It becomes a key abstraction if it contains a mapping of all the products in the Inventory and their respective quantities."
"A store has different types of items and certain quantity of items(ie., instances) of each type. For example, the store may have 5 items of the item-type soap and 3 items of the item-type shampoo etc.The term item is used in two different senses in the requirements statement:1) as an item-type in the sentences 'Each item has a unique barcode, a specific (wholesale) cost, and a specific (retail) price' and 'The manager adds or removes items from the inventory, e.g., when a manufacturer introduces or discontinues an item'.2) as an instance of an item in 'A clerk adds or removes items from the inventory when a customer purchases or returns an item.'The first use represents the key abstraction."
"The term ""item"" is used ambiguously. Usually it means one thing that we could use in daily life, but in the sentence, ""Each item has a unique barcode, a specific (wholesale) cost, and a specific (retail) price."" it is more like a record. The later use is the key abstraction."
is system a class or function or systems refers to the whole inventory management system where the more specification is required where which class will implement reordering.
"The system is used as reordering the item on basis of reorder point and the system is also adjusting reorder points based on how quickly the store's stock has been depleted, and how fast orders have been filled in the past. Former is used as key abstraction."
"It seems the ""adding"" an item to inventory done by the manager is different from the ""adding"" to the inventory done by the clerk. The manager will be adding completely new items to the inventory while the clerk will be adding items that already exist."
1. In first sense the User is represented as a Manager.2. In second case the User is represented as a Clerk.The key abstraction is User. Even though the term User is not directly used anywhere in the description. But it is evident that the key abstraction is User.
"In requirement 3, it is mentioned that each item has a cost. It is stated as:Each item has a unique barcode, a specific (wholesale) cost, and a specific (retail) price.In requirement 4, it is mentioned that cost depends on quantity. It is stated as:Either the cost or the price of the item may depend on the quantity bought or sold.The use in requirement 3 is the key abstraction. It says cost reflects wholesale cost for Item.In requirement 4, it is ambiguously denoted that this cost depends on quantity bought or sold."
Order could be the cost when the item was purchased or the purchase of an item. Order represents the purchase of an item here.
"Usually it means a certain item in the store. But in ""A clerk adds or removes items...""it's referring to the amount of items. The former use is the key abstraction."
"It usually means the number of specific item. But in the sentence ""The system reorders an item, when the number in stock falls below a reorder point."" it really mean the total number of items. The former use is a key abstract."
"""The system adjusts reorder points based on how quickly the store's stock has been depleted, and how fast orders have been filled in the past."" In this sentence, stock means inventory. Inventory is the key abstraction."
"The system is ambiguously in the requirements, it can reorder an item, however the clerk and manager also can add the item from inventory."
"In the sentences, ""The system reorders an item, when the number in stock falls below a reorder point"", the stock is used as the quantity of the item. Stock is the key abstraction"
The mission is to keep track of the inventory for a small store.The inventory consists of a number of items. << This is the abstractionThe manager adds or removes items from the inventoryA clerk adds or removes items from the inventory
It can refer to both a manager or a clerk.
"The stock falls below a reorder point means the number of one specific item.In another sentence "" stock has been depleted "" it means all items in the stock,which is the key abstraction"
"The cost may means a lot of things in naming, which could be the cost of retail or cost of import. etc, so we need to define it like wholesale_cost, and that's will be unambiguous."
"The term ""system"" is used ambiguously. Usually, it refers to a group of items working together but here however it is used as a computer/tracker that tracks the count of the individual items"
"The key abstraction: ""Each item has a unique barcode, a specific (wholesale) cost, and a specific (retail) price."" This infers that an Item is an object that contains other properties and is, therefore, a key abstraction. It is used ambiguously (in the context of a collection) as inventory and stock?these are just collections of Items."
"The system is ambiguously being used instead of inventory in the latter two parts of the requirement, where the system in this case is the inventory of items in the store. The items are reordered in the inventory based on the reorder point and also reorder points is based on item depletion."
"The line ""The system adjusts reorder points based on how quickly the store's stock has been depleted"", it actually refers to the quantity of the item in question.The line ""The system adjusts reorder points based on how quickly the store's stock has been depleted, and how fast orders have been filled in the past."" Uses stock differently"
"In point 1, Inventory is used as a collection of items. In point 6, the word ""inventory"" is being confused with the word ""stock"". Stock should represent the amount left of each item. Inventory does not represent this. Inventory has items and items have stock. So stock should be what is changed when a specific item is bought or returned. Inventory is used correctly in point 5 when it says that a manager can add/remove items from an inventory."
"Stock could mean inventory or could mean default. Here, stock is used instead of inventory. It should have been store's inventory in the last point."
"Either as the total quantity that the specific item has ever been bought or sold, or as the speed how fast it is bought or sold, which is the same as the quantity that the specific item bought or sold in a given period of time.And in this case, the latter one is used, because it makes sense to decide prices based on how fast an item is bought or sold."
"The system reorders an item, when the number in stock falls below a reorder point.In this it means quantity of items.Stock originally means total number of items present"
"The word items is used ambiguously when the requirements reference a clerk's responsibility to add or remove ""items"" when a customer buys or returns one of a given item. This usage is actually referring to an update to the instance variable quantity for a given item. The typical usage defines item properly in the cases where the requirements define that an inventory has many items and each item has a given quantity. It is also correct to say that a manager is adding or removing items from the inventory as they will actually instantiate or delete item instances."
System is used here to refer to functionality and also refers to the inventory itself.
"Because,system is referred once to reorder an item,again used to say that it adjusts reorder points"
inventory has items
The manager adds or removes items from the inventory in this it say item is removed or added but it refers to the quantity of the item
"First, it used to mean a kind of items, each has an attribute quantity.Second, it used to represent one entity of an item.The first use represents the key abstraction."
"System is used in a lot of different scenarios throughout the requirements, and its unclear what it exactly is."
"The term ""inventory"" is used ambiguously.Usually, it means a number. but in the sentence, ""Either the cost or the price of the item may depend on the quantity bought or sold."", it is more like the speed of selling or buying something. It has a limitation that the quantity bought or sold in a specific time."
"In the sentence ""The system reorders an item, when the number in stock falls below a reorder point."", the system means the manager.In the sentence ""The system adjusts reorder points based on how quickly the store's stock has been depleted, and how fast orders have been filled in the past."", the system means the system. It adjusts reorder points using some algorithms automatically. The second use represents the key abstraction."
